Plisky.Plumbing - ConfigHub.
===========================================

ConfigHub uses the Hub context from Plisky Plumbing to provide application configuration anywhere wtihin the codebase irrespective of how the 
applicaiton configuration is to work for a given solution. It can therefore be used with app.config / web.config or any other form of configuration
to support the application configuration needs.

ConfigHub also has a built in DateTime function to get the current date, allowing for mocking and abstraction of the system DateTime.
